>Questions: Who, What, When, and Why

>Who: Who are you targeting? 

>Meaning: Who is it for?

>Answer: I am targeting kids education.

>Paragraph: I am targeting kids education. Kids education is very important to me because I usually help out my family and I thought helping others would make great difference in my life. That's also how I got an idea to want to to help kids learn from website. My website is most likely targeting my family, friends, and kids because they're the most people who helped me get ideas. Thank you family, friends, and kids! Every single day when I go to school and come back, I'm full with joy, love, and kindness. It feels awsome when I get to see my friends. 

>What: What do you do?

>Meaning: How are you unique?

>Answer: I am unique by being myself, helping others, and teaching other kids.

>Paragraph:  I am unique by being myself, helping others, and teaching other kids. The 1st reason why I am unique is because of being myself, if I wished to be you and my wish became true, I would probably not know what to do. The 2nd reason why I am unique is because I help others, if people never cared about what other people do or say this world would be like a trash can with trash in it. The 3rd reason why I am unique is because of me or anyone teaching other kids, if kids didn't learn anything, imagine what they will learn and do when they grow up. Everyone has atleast 1 reason to be unique or to express your self with.

>When: When did you start?

>Meaning: How did you get interested in making the website?

>Answer: I got interested in making winteria-school.github.io by learning HTML CSS  .

>Paragraph: I got interested in making the website by learning HTML and CSS. I learned HTML and CSS with https://www.khanacademy.org/. One day, my dad told me to go on khanacademy to do some math, I didn't want to do math so I went to khanacademy's settings and looked at computer programming, I explored and I loved it! That's how I just watched the videos to do it and the practice models to learn but then I saw a video that said that we could make our own website with  https://github.com/, I thought that I had learned enough HTML and CSS code to finally make a website. So, I started making the website with visual studio code. I liked visual studio code because it usually does half of the work for us and it took lot less time to finish. When I was in the middle of my website I was confused and didn't know what to do so I started publishing it to Github and experienced that it was good and I finished my very own website!

>Why: Why do you do it?

>Meaning: Why should we care?

>Answer: I care about other's education because if they don't learn anything as a kid, what will they learn when they grow up?

>Paragraph: I care about kids education. The 1st reason why I care about kids education is because kids learn a lot of things easier as a kid than a child or a grown up, so, if kids don't learn anything as a kid, what will they learn when they grow up? The 2nd reason why I care about kids education is because when kids grow up and kids don't have any education, they will have a hard time having a job, working on his/her job, and even for his/her own matters. The 3rd reason why I care about kids education is because kids might not understand how to read, write, or do math, if they don't learn how to do that, the future of kids are going to be frustrating to go into. I care about kids more than anything exept my family and friends.
